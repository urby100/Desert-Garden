# 🌸 Desert Garden 🌵💐

### Graduation project from 2019 👴👴👴👴
The goal was to create an entire game by myself and learn about the process of game creation, from ideas to realization...

### The result was this 2D side scroller.

The game starts with a story.
<br>
<img src="readmesrc/intro1.gif" width=500px></img>
<br>
Two pilots are sent into the desert by plane to drop a test bomb.
<br>
The rookie pilot stops the plane while they're in the air by mistake... The main character jumps out midflight for some reason.
<br>

<br>
The main character finds the rookie alive and well sitting inside the crashed plane. The rookie waves at the protagonist while holding a screwdriver in his hand. The screwdriver slips from his hand onto the bomb below the plane, triggering it and sending the whole plane into the unknown sky :o
<br>

<br>
The bomb contains chemicals that turn any living thing into something you don't wanna mess with :O(oh, snap)
<br>
...Gameplay commences. I didn't have the energy to add a tutorial :D
<br>
Anyway...The cacti can't hurt you, they only disrupt your movement. Only monsters can kill you.

### Watering the cacti inherits their abilities

...Back to the story
<br>
The protagonist finds the rookie, and they head back to HQ.
Something is happening inside of HQ,... oh nooooo one of the scientists went insaaaane and made the whole HQ infested with monsters and dangerous plants :D
The rookie goes home, because he doesn't work overtime or something.
<br>

<br>
Inside HQ, you have to navigate the dangerous maze to get to the scientist and save him!!!...
(forgot to add a prompt or something that you're all out of water, so you can't use any abilities...)
<br>
### Floor 1

### Floor 2

### Floor 3
<img src="readmesrc/boss3.gif" width=500px></img>
<br>
At the end of the maze, you find some water and splash it onto the scientist to calm him down or something. You're a hero woohooo...
<br>
### Floor 4
<img src="readmesrc/boss4.gif" width=500px></img>
<br>
At the end of the story, the two chat and see a bigger, scarier, powerful (cue Oppenheimer "destroyer of worlds") big bomb shot out of HQ. The scientist, while under the influence of crazy toxic fumes, apparently created it and set a timer to do the thing that it did. Someone's gonna have to clean that up...

The End.

### Implemented scripts for audio effects and background music.(Couldn't be bothered creating my own 🦥)

### Sprites and animations created by ME with ❤️, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.

### Here are a couple of still frames from 2 characters, and all the plants and "monsters" 😊.

###### Disclamer - It's old, it's buggy :D, but I still like it.
